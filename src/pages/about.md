Hello ðŸ‘‹

I was born in Denmark and graduated from Aalborg University with a masters
in Computer Science in 2016. Later in 2016, I moved to Brisbane, Australia, followed by Melbourne
in 2021, where I currently reside.

Since moving to Australia, I've taken an interest in application development,
and have worked with Ruby on Rails as a consultant, primarily as a backend developer.
More recently, I've been working with DevOps, security, and infrastructure.

From November 2020, I've been working for [Australia and New Zealand Banking Group][ANZ] as a software
engineer, specifically on [ANZ Plus], which is a new account offering from ANZ.

You can read more about my professional experience on [my CV][CV].
