Moving my site from Hugo to Astro because who doesn't love trying new technology
and procrasinating actually doing any writing.

A long time in the making, it's given me a chance to try a lot of technologies
I've had on my list to learn this year, specifically [Tailwindcss] and [Astro],
but most importantly a start on my journey to write pubicly.

[Tailwindcss]: https://tailwindcss.com
[Astro]: https://astro.build/
